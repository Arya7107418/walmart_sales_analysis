# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end HR Analytics solution using Power BI that transformed raw attendance data into strategic workforce insights. Built for a 300+ employee organization, this dashboard enables data-driven HR decision-making through comprehensive analysis of presence patterns, remote work trends, and sick leave utilization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Workforce Optimization**: Analyze employee presence, WFH%, and sick leave patterns to identify productivity trends
- **Strategic Dashboard Development**: Build an interactive, executive-ready dashboard for HR managers & leadership
- **Predictive Insights**: Identify seasonal/weekly patterns that influence attrition, productivity, and resource planning
- **Policy Enhancement**: Provide data-backed recommendations for attendance and remote work policies

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & interactive dashboard building
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning, transformation & ETL processes
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Advanced measures & calculated columns
- **Excel/CSV** – Multi-source raw HR data integration
- **Statistical Analysis** – Trend identification and pattern recognition

## 📊 Key Features
### Interactive Analytics
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Month, department, and employee-level drill-downs
- **Real-time KPIs**: Presence %, WFH %, Sick Leave % with trend indicators

- **Data Quality Management**: Handled inconsistent formatting and missing values
- **Custom DAX Calculations**: 
  - `Presence % = DIVIDE([Present Days], [Total Working Days], 0)`
  - `WFH % = DIVIDE([WFH Days], [Total Working Days], 0)`
  - `SL % = DIVIDE([Sick Leave Days], [Total Working Days], 0)`

### Business Intelligence Features
- **Seasonal Trend Analysis**: Heat-map visualizations for monthly patterns
- **Weekly Performance Metrics**: Day-of-week attendance optimization
